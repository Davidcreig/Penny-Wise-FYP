## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>
My student budgeting application is designed to simplify financial management for UK students by combining intelligent automation with an intuitive interface. The app features OCR receipt scanning powered by Asprise API to instantly capture and categorize purchases, a student loan repayment prediction tool that helps users understand long term financial commitments, and a streamlined expense tracking system that makes it easy to monitor daily spending. Alongside these core tools, the app also offers additional features that enhance financial awareness and make managing money easier, more accurate, and more convenient for students.

## <a name="tech-stack">⚙️ Tech Stack</a>

- **[Expo](https://expo.dev/)** is an open-source platform for building universal native apps (Android, iOS, web) using JavaScript/TypeScript and React Native. It features file-based routing via Expo Router, fast refresh, native modules for camera/maps/notifications, over-the-air updates (EAS), and streamlined app deployment.

- **[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)** is a framework for building mobile UIs with React. It enables component‑based, cross-platform development with declarative UI, deep native API support, and is tightly integrated with Expo for navigation and native capabilities.

- **[Appwrite](https://jsm.dev/rn25-appwrite)** is an open-source backend-as-a-service platform offering secure authentication (email/password, OAuth, SMS, magic links), databases, file storage with compression/encryption, real-time messaging, serverless functions, and static site hosting via Appwrite Sites—all managed through a unified console and microservices architecture.

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript providing type annotations, interfaces, enums, generics, and enhanced tooling. It improves error detection, code quality, and scalability—ideal for robust, maintainable projects.

- **[NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/)** brings Tailwind CSS to React Native and Expo, allowing you to style mobile components using utility-first classes for fast, consistent, and responsive UI design.

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** is a utility-first CSS framework enabling rapid UI design via low-level classes. In React Native/Expo, it’s commonly used with NativeWind to apply Tailwind-style utilities to mobile components.

- **[Asprise API](https://asprise.com/receipt-ocr/blog-GB-uk-receipt-ocr)** is a fast, lightweight optical character recognition solution used to scan receipts and extract structured data. In my app, it processes receipt images to automatically identify and return key details such as store names, dates, and totals.

## <a name="features">🔋 Features</a>

👉 **Authentication with Google**: Apart from simple email registration, the app also offers secure and effortless sign-in for students using Google’s authentication service.

👉 **OCR Receipt Scanning**: Uses the Asprise API to scan and extract data from receipts instantly for automatic expense entry.

👉 **Loan Prediction Tool**: Provides student loan repayment estimates to help users understand future financial commitments.

…and many more features, including clean code architecture, component reusability, and a smooth, student friendly user experience.
